![100DaysOfCode](http://www.finaldraftdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/100DaysofCode_1200x500.jpg)
I’ve been thinking for a while to start coding more frequently. I’ve set some really important goals that I wish to attain in the near future. 

My laziness is taking over me. Although, I spent my summer vacation this time really well. I learned a couple of new things. But these are not enough to achieve the goals that I have set.

So, if you know me, you would know that I’m a big procrastinator. I procrastinate on most of the things. But, this doesn’t mean that I leave everything. I eventually do my work, but with a slight delay. I really want to minimize this habit of mine. 

It has been 2 weeks since I decided that I will start a challenge for myself. 

_**Starting #100DaysofCode**_

I’ve heard a lot about this challenge. 

In this challenge, I will be coding every single day for the next 100 days continuously(?).

Due to academic issues, I might not be able to code for a certain period of time. This will not break or stop the challenge because I’ve completely different major at my university that I have to deal with every single day. But that is not a problem. People from different majors in the past have done it and I will definitely do it. 

So, the challenge will be as follow:-

* I’ll be spending at least one-hour coding every day. Be it learning something new, or solving algorithmic problems. Solving programming problems or working on a project. All of these will count towards this.
* On the weekends, I’ll be spending at least two hours towards this goal. This is super compulsory. 
* If one a particular day, I’m not able to code for an obvious reason, I will not be stopping and will continue from the very next day.
* I’ll update my daily activity on Twitter with hashtag, #100DaysofCode. You can follow me on Twitter, my username is @SameerChoubey98
* Every 2 or 3 weeks, I’ll post a summary of the things, I’ve learned in the last couple of days.

_**What I aim to with the help of this challenge?**_

I aim to improve myself as a person who can take challenges. Over the time, I have analyzed myself and found out that I really need to improve in some of the areas and it is necessary.

I aim to make myself more productive because productivity is something that can take you really far and when I say this, I mean it.

I aim to generate a habit to work on my goals regularly. Although I’ve some sort of interest in this field, there is something I lag no matter which filed it is. I give up things very often after starting. I don’t want to do that. I wish to improve myself.

I’ll be updating about this challenge after 10 days from now. 12th Aug 2018, mark the timing :).
